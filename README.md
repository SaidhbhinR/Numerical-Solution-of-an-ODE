# Numerical-Solution-of-an-ODE
 Plotting the direction field for t shows the direction of the solution of the ODE.The Simple Euler method yielded a numerical solution for the ODE which was in consensus with the direction field for tthis numerical solution became more accurate when using the improved Euler Method and improved once more when using the Runge- Kutta method.
